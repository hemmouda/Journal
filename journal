Journal, a bash script for your simple journaling.


Usage:
	journal [ h | l | u | YYYY mm dd ]

	Simply run \`journal\` with no arguments to write a journal for today. Some settings can be modified inside the script, like wether or not to lock the journals by default, what editor to use, and some other stuff.


Options:
	h, -h, --help   	show this help message.
	l, -l           	create a journal that will be locked.
	u, -u           	create a journal that will remain unlocked.
	YYYY mm dd      	read the journal written on the YYYY mm dd.	


Examples:
    journal            		write a journal for today or add an entry.
    journal l          		write and lock today's new journal.
    journal 1970 01 01   	read the journal from January, first, 1970.
