Journal, a bash script for your simple journaling.


Usage:
	journal [ h | l | u | t | y | r | YYYY mm dd ]

	Simply run \`journal\` with no arguments to write a journal for today. Some settings can be modified inside the script, like wether or not to lock the journals by default, what editor to use, and some other stuff.


Options:
	h, -h, --help       	show this help message.
	l, -l, --locked     	create a journal that will be locked.
	u, -u, --unlocked   	create a journal that will remain unlocked.
	t, -t, --today      	read todays' journal.
	y, -y, --yesterday  	read yesterdays' journal.
	r, -r, --read       	alias for \`t\`.
	YYYY mm dd          	read the journal written on the YYYY mm dd.	


Examples:
	journal             	write a journal for today or add an entry.
	journal l           	write and lock today's new journal.
	journal y           	read yesterdays' journal.
	journal 1970 01 01  	read the journal from January, first, 1970.
